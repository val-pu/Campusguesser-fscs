# CampusGuesser

*CampusGuesser* is a game like *GeoGuesser*, but it is designed to match the Heinrich-Heine-University.
The game works so far, but there have improvements to be done and we have a few more features in mind
we want to add. Moreover, the documentation is very poor at this stage of development, so we definitely
have to change this.
